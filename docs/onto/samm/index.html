<div class="desc">You review the application security plan periodically for ongoing applicability and support of the organization’s evolving needs and future growth. To do this, you repeat the steps from the first two maturity levels of this Security Practice at least annually. The goal is for the plan to always support the current and future needs of the organization, which ensures the program is aligned with the business.

In addition to reviewing the business drivers, the organization closely monitors the success of the implementation of each of the roadmap milestones. You evaluate the success of the milestones based on a wide range of criteria, including completeness and efficiency of the implementation, budget considerations, and any cultural impacts or changes resulting from the initiative. You review missed or unsatisfactory milestones and evaluate possible changes to the overall program.

The organization develops dashboards and measurements for management and teams responsible for software development to monitor the implementation of the roadmap. These dashboards are detailed enough to identify individual projects and initiatives and provide a clear understanding of whether the program is successful and aligned with the organization’s needs.

You review the application security plan periodically for ongoing applicability and support of the organization’s evolving needs and future growth. To do this, you repeat the steps from the first two maturity levels of this Security Practice at least annually. The goal is for the plan to always support the current and future needs of the organization, which ensures the program is aligned with the business.

In addition to reviewing the business drivers, the organization closely monitors the success of the implementation of each of the roadmap milestones. You evaluate the success of the milestones based on a wide range of criteria, including completeness and efficiency of the implementation, budget considerations, and any cultural impacts or changes resulting from the initiative. You review missed or unsatisfactory milestones and evaluate possible changes to the overall program.

The organization develops dashboards and measurements for management and teams responsible for software development to monitor the implementation of the roadmap. These dashboards are detailed enough to identify individual projects and initiatives and provide a clear understanding of whether the program is successful and aligned with the organization’s needs.

Continuously maintain and improve the reference architecture based on new insights in the organization and within the community. Have architects, senior developers and other technical stakeholders participate in design and creation of reference platforms. After creation, teams maintain ongoing support and updates.

Reference architectures may materialize into a set of software libraries and tools upon which project teams build their software. They serve as a starting point that standardizes the configuration-driven, security-by-default security approach. You can bootstrap the framework by selecting a particular project early in the lifecycle and having security-savvy staff work with them to build the security functionality in a generic way so that it can be extracted from the project and used elsewhere in the organization.

Monitor weaknesses or gaps in the set of security solutions available in your organization continuously in the context of discussions on architecture, development, or operations. This serves as an input to improve the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reference architectures that you have in place.

<div class="desc">Conduct instructor-led or CBT security training specific to the organization’s roles and technologies, starting with the core development team. The organization customizes training for product managers, software developers, testers, and security auditors, based on each group’s technical needs.

- Product managers train on topics related to SAMM business functions and security practices, with emphasis on security requirements, threat modeling, and defect tracking.
- Developers train on coding standards and best practices for the technologies they work with to ensure the training directly benefits application security. They have a solid technical understanding of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, or similar weaknesses relevant to the technologies and frameworks used (e.g. mobile), and the most common remediation strategies for each issue.
- Testers train on the different testing tools and best practices for technologies used in the organization, and in tools that identify security defects.
- Security auditors train on the software development lifecycle, application security mechanisms used in the organization, and the process for submitting security defects for remediation.
- Security Champions train on security topics from various phases of the SDLC. They receive the same training as developers and testers, but also understand threat modeling and secure design, as well as security tools and technologies that can be integrated into the build environment.

Include all training content from the Maturity Level 1 activities of this stream and additional role-specific and technology-specific content. Eliminate unnecessary aspects of the training.

Ideally, identify a subject-matter expert in each technology to assist with procuring or developing the training content and updating it regularly. The training consists of demonstrations of vulnerability exploitation using intentionally weakened applications, such as WebGoat or Juice Shop. Include results of the previous penetration as examples of vulnerabilities and implemented remediation strategies. Ask a penetration tester to assist with developing examples of vulnerability exploitation demonstrations.

Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development, and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance.  Whenever possible, training should also include a test to ensure understanding, not just compliance.  Update and deliver training annually to include changes in the organization, technology, and trends. Poll training participants to evaluate the quality and relevance of the training. Gather suggestions of other information relevant to their work or environments.

<div class="desc">Define and document metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the application security program. This way improvements are measurable and you can use them to secure future support and funding for the program. Considering the dynamic nature of most development environments, metrics should be comprised of measurements in the following categories

* `Effort` metrics measure the effort spent on security. For example training hours, time spent performing code reviews, and number of applications scanned for vulnerabilities.
* `Result` metrics measure the results of security efforts. Examples include number of outstanding patches with security defects and number of security incidents involving application vulnerabilities.
* `Environment` metrics measure the environment where security efforts take place. Examples include number of applications or lines of code as a measure of difficulty or complexity.

Each metric by itself is useful for a specific purpose, but a combination of two or three metrics together helps explain spikes in metrics trends. For example, a spike in a total number of vulnerabilities may be caused by the organization on-boarding several new applications that have not been previously exposed to the implemented application security mechanisms. Alternatively, an increase in the environment metrics without a corresponding increase in the effort or result could be an indicator of a mature and efficient security program.

While identifying metrics, it’s always recommended to stick to the metrics that meet several criteria

* Consistently Measured
* Inexpensive to gather
* Expressed as a cardinal number or a percentage
* Expressed as a unit of measure

Document metrics and include descriptions of best and most efficient methods for gathering data, as well as recommended methods for combining individual measures into meaningful metrics. For example, a number of applications and a total number of defects across all applications may not be useful by themselves but, when combined as a number of outstanding high-severity defects per application, they provide a more actionable metric.

Define and document metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the application security program. This way improvements are measurable and you can use them to secure future support and funding for the program. Considering the dynamic nature of most development environments, metrics should be comprised of measurements in the following categories

* `Effort` metrics measure the effort spent on security. For example training hours, time spent performing code reviews, and number of applications scanned for vulnerabilities.
* `Result` metrics measure the results of security efforts. Examples include number of outstanding patches with security defects and number of security incidents involving application vulnerabilities.
* `Environment` metrics measure the environment where security efforts take place. Examples include number of applications or lines of code as a measure of difficulty or complexity.

Each metric by itself is useful for a specific purpose, but a combination of two or three metrics together helps explain spikes in metrics trends. For example, a spike in a total number of vulnerabilities may be caused by the organization on-boarding several new applications that have not been previously exposed to the implemented application security mechanisms. Alternatively, an increase in the environment metrics without a corresponding increase in the effort or result could be an indicator of a mature and efficient security program.

While identifying metrics, it’s always recommended to stick to the metrics that meet several criteria

* Consistently Measured
* Inexpensive to gather
* Expressed as a cardinal number or a percentage
* Expressed as a unit of measure

Document metrics and include descriptions of best and most efficient methods for gathering data, as well as recommended methods for combining individual measures into meaningful metrics. For example, a number of applications and a total number of defects across all applications may not be useful by themselves but, when combined as a number of outstanding high-severity defects per application, they provide a more actionable metric.

<div class="desc">Increase the effectiveness of automated security testing tools by tuning and customizing them for your particular technology stacks and applications. Automated security testing tools have 2 important characteristics: Their false positive rate, i.e. the non-existent bugs and vulnerabilities they incorrectly report; their false negative rate, i.e. actual bugs and vulnerabilities which they fail to detect. As you mature in your use of automated testing tools, you strive to minimize their false positive and false negative rates. This maximizes the time development teams spend reviewing and addressing real security issues in their applications, and reduces the friction typically associated with using untuned automated security analysis tools.

Start by disabling tool support for technologies and frameworks you do not use and target specific versions where possible. This will increase execution speed and reduce the number spurious results reported. Rely on security tool champions or shared security teams to pilot the tools in coordination with a select group of motivated development teams. This will identify likely false positive findings to ignore or remove from the tools' output. Identify specific security issues and anti-patterns and favor the best tool for detecting them.

Leverage available tool features to take application-specific and organizational coding styles, as well as technical standards into account. Many automated static analysis tools allow users to write their own rules or customize default analysis rules to the specific software interfaces in the project under test for improved accuracy and depth of coverage. For example, potentially dangerous input (aka tainted) can be marked as safe after it flows through a designated custom sanitization method.

Strategically, it is better to reliably detect a limited subset of security issues via automated tooling, and incrementally extend coverage than attempting to detect all known issues immediately. Once the tools have been sufficiently tuned, they can be made available to a more development teams. It is important to continuously monitor their perceived efficacy among development teams. In more advanced forms, machine learning techniques can be adopted to identify and automatically filter out likely false positives at scale.

<div class="desc">To assist with the ongoing implementation and verification of compliance with policies and standards, develop application security and appropriate test scripts related to each applicable requirement. Organize these documents into libraries and make them available to all application teams in formats most conducive for inclusion into each application. Clearly label the documents and link them to the policies and standards they represent, to assist with the ongoing updates and maintenance. Version policies and standards and include detailed change logs with each iterative update to make ongoing inclusion into different products’ SDLC easier.

Write application security requirements in a format consistent with the existing requirements management processes. You may need more than one version catering to different development methodologies or technologies. The goal is to make it easy for various product teams to incorporate policies and standards into their existing development life-cycles needing minimal interpretation of requirements.

Test scripts help reinforce application security requirements through clear expectations of application functionality, and guide automated or manual testing efforts that may already be part of the development process. These efforts not only help each team establish the current state of compliance with existing policies and standards, but also ensure compliance as applications continue to change.

To assist with the ongoing implementation and verification of compliance with policies and standards, develop application security and appropriate test scripts related to each applicable requirement. Organize these documents into libraries and make them available to all application teams in formats most conducive for inclusion into each application. Clearly label the documents and link them to the policies and standards they represent, to assist with the ongoing updates and maintenance. Version policies and standards and include detailed change logs with each iterative update to make ongoing inclusion into different products’ SDLC easier.

Write application security requirements in a format consistent with the existing requirements management processes. You may need more than one version catering to different development methodologies or technologies. The goal is to make it easy for various product teams to incorporate policies and standards into their existing development life-cycles needing minimal interpretation of requirements.

Test scripts help reinforce application security requirements through clear expectations of application functionality, and guide automated or manual testing efforts that may already be part of the development process. These efforts not only help each team establish the current state of compliance with existing policies and standards, but also ensure compliance as applications continue to change.

Keep all resources necessary for these procedures (e.g., separate communicating infrastructure or reliable external location) ready to use. Detect and correct unavailability of these resources in a timely manner.

Carry out incident and emergency exercises are regularly. Use the results for process improvement.

Define, gather, evaluate, and act upon metrics on the incident response process, including its continuous improvement.

With the multiplicity of security tools running at every phase of development, remediating security issues at a designated stage (such as pre-release testing) is no longer appropriate or desirable. Security issues must be quickly triaged and fixes planned in a tradeoff between risk and cost of remediation. Continuously striving to detect issues earlier in the development lifecycle, via specific, low-friction automated tests integrated into development tools and build processes, lowers the cost of remediation thereby increasing the likelihood of issues being quickly resolved.

Proactively improve the security testing effort integrated into the development process by adequately propagating the results of other security test activities. For example, if a security penetration test identifies issues with session management, any changes to session management should trigger explicit security tests before pushing the changes to production.

Security champions and the central secure software group continuously review results from automated and manual security tests during development, including these results as part of the security awareness trainings for the development teams. Integrate lessons learned in overall playbooks to improve security testing as part of the organization development. If there are unaddressed findings that remain as accepted risks for the release, stakeholders and development managers should work together to establish a concrete timeframe for addressing them.

For software developed by the organization, deliver releases to customers and organization-managed solutions on a regular basis (e.g., monthly), regardless of whether you are including new features.

Create guidance for prioritizing component patching, reflecting your risk tolerance and management objectives. Consider operational factors (e.g., criticality of the application, severity of the vulnerabilities addressed) in determining priorities for testing and applying patches.

In the event receive a notification for a critical vulnerability in a component, while no patch is yet available, triage and handle the situation as a risk management issue (e.g., implement compensating controls, obtain customer risk acceptance, or disable affected applications/features).

Develop and follow a well-defined process for managing patches to application components across the technology stacks in use. Ensure processes include regular schedules for applying vendor updates, aligned with vendor update calendars (e.g., Microsoft Patch Tuesday). For software developed by the organization, deliver releases to customers and organization-managed solutions on a regular basis (e.g., monthly), regardless of whether you are including new features.

Create guidance for prioritizing component patching, reflecting your risk tolerance and management objectives. Consider operational factors (e.g., criticality of the application, severity of the vulnerabilities addressed) in determining priorities for testing and applying patches.

In the event receive a notification for a critical vulnerability in a component, while no patch is yet available, triage and handle the situation as a risk management issue (e.g., implement compensating controls, obtain customer risk acceptance, or disable affected applications/features).

To ascertain these threats, interview business owners and stakeholders and document drivers specific to industries where the organization operates as well as drivers specific to the organization. Gathered information includes worst-case scenarios that could impact the organization, as well as opportunities where an optimized software development lifecycle and more secure applications could provide a market-differentiator or create additional opportunities.

Gathered information provides a baseline for the organization to develop and promote its application security program. Items in the program are prioritized to address threats and opportunities most important to the organization. The baseline is split into several risk factors and drivers linked directly to the organization’s priorities and used to help build a risk profile of each custom-developed application by documenting how they can impact the organization if they are compromised.

The baseline and individual risk factors should be published and made available to application development teams to ensure a more transparent process of creating application risk profiles and incorporating the organization’s priorities into the program. Additionally, these goals should provide a set of objectives which should be used to ensure all application security program enhancements provide direct support of the organization’s current and future needs.

To ascertain these threats, interview business owners and stakeholders and document drivers specific to industries where the organization operates as well as drivers specific to the organization. Gathered information includes worst-case scenarios that could impact the organization, as well as opportunities where an optimized software development lifecycle and more secure applications could provide a market-differentiator or create additional opportunities.

Gathered information provides a baseline for the organization to develop and promote its application security program. Items in the program are prioritized to address threats and opportunities most important to the organization. The baseline is split into several risk factors and drivers linked directly to the organization’s priorities and used to help build a risk profile of each custom-developed application by documenting how they can impact the organization if they are compromised.

The baseline and individual risk factors should be published and made available to application development teams to ensure a more transparent process of creating application risk profiles and incorporating the organization’s priorities into the program. Additionally, these goals should provide a set of objectives which should be used to ensure all application security program enhancements provide direct support of the organization’s current and future needs.

Conducting security tests as early as the requirements or design phases can be beneficial. While traditionally used for functional test cases, this type of test-driven development approach involves identifying and running relevant security test cases early in the development cycle. With the automatic execution of security test cases, projects enter the implementation phase with a number of failing tests for the non-existent functionality. Implementation is complete when all the tests pass. This provides a clear, upfront goal for developers early in the development cycle, lowering risk of release delays due to security concerns or forced acceptance of risk to meet project deadlines.

Make the results of automated and manual security tests visible via dashboards, and routinely present them to management and business stakeholders (e.g. before each release) for review. If there are unaddressed findings that remain as accepted risks for the release, stakeholders and development managers work together to establish a concrete timeframe for addressing them. Continuously review and improve the quality of the security tests.

Consider and implement security test correlation tools to automate the matching and merging of test results from dynamic, static, and interactive application scanners into one central dashboard, providing direct input towards Defect Management. Spread the knowledge of the created security tests and the results across the development team to improve security knowledge and awareness inside the organization.

<div class="desc">The goal of this activity is to thoroughly understand the risk level of all applications within the organization, to focus the effort of your software assurance activities where it really matters.

From a risk evaluation perspective, the basic set of questions is not enough to thoroughly evaluate the risk of all applications. Create an extensive and standardized way to evaluate the risk of the application, among others via their impact on information security (confidentiality, integrity and availability of data). Next to security, you also want to evaluate the privacy risk of the application. Understand the data that the application processes and what potential privacy violations are relevant. Finally, study the impact that this application has on other applications within the organization (e.g., the application might be modifying data that was considered read-only in another context). Evaluate all applications within the organization, including all existing and legacy ones.

Leverage business impact analysis to quantify and classify application risk. A simple qualitative scheme (such as high/medium/low) is not enough to effectively manage and compare applications on an enterprise-wide level.

Based on this input, Security Officers leverage the classification to define the risk profile to build a centralized inventory of risk profiles and manage accountability. This inventory gives Product Owners, Managers, and other organizational stakeholders an aligned view of the risk level of an application in order to assign appropriate priority to security-related activities.

Understand the types and sensitivity of data stored and processed by your applications, and maintain awareness of the fate of processed data (e.g., backups, sharing with external partners). At this level of maturity, the information gathered may be captured in varying forms and different places; no organization-wide data catalog is assumed to exist. Protect and handle all data associated with a given application according to protection requirements applying to the most sensitive data stored and processed.

Implement basic controls, to prevent propagation of unsanitized sensitive data from production environments to lower environments. By ensuring unsanitized production data are never propagated to lower (non-production) environments, you can focus data protection policies and activities on production.

Consider using a set of 5-10 questions to understand important application characteristics, such as whether the application processes financial data, whether it is internet facing, or whether privacy-related data is involved. The application risk profile tells you whether these factors are applicable and if they could significatly impact the organization.

Next, use a scheme to classify applications according to this risk. A simple, qualitative scheme (e.g. high/medium/low) that translates these characteristics into a value is often effective. It is important to use these values to represent and compare the risk of different applications against each other.

<div class="desc">Use automated static and dynamic security test tools for software, resulting in more efficient security testing and higher quality results. Progressively increase the frequency of security tests and extend code coverage.

Application security testing can be performed statically, by inspecting an application's source code without running it, or dynamically by simply observing the application's behavior in response to various input conditions. The former approach is often referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), the latter as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). A hybrid approach, known as Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), combines the strengths of both approaches (at the cost of additional overhead) by dynamically testing automatically instrumented applications, allowing accurate monitoring of the application's internal state in response to external input.

Many security vulnerabilties are very hard to detect without carefully inspecting the source code. While this is ideally performed by expert or peer review, it is a slow and expensive task. Although "noisier" and frequently less accurate than expert-led reviews, automated SAST tools are cheaper, much faster, and more consistent than humans. A number of commercial and free tools are able to efficiently detect sufficiently important bugs and vulnerabilities in large code bases.

Dynamic testing does not require application source code, making it ideal for cases where source code is not available. It also identifies concrete instances of vulnerabilities. Due to its "black-box" approach , without instrumentation, it is more likely to uncover shallow bugs. Dynamic testing tools need a large source of test data whose manual test generation is prohibitive. Many tools exist which generate suitable test data automatically, leading to more efficient security testing and higher quality results.

Select appropriate tools based on several factors, including depth and accuracy of inspection, robustness and accuracy of security test cases, available integrations with other tools, usage and cost model, etc. When selecting tools, use input from security-savvy technical staff as well as developers and development managers and review results with stakeholders.

Threat modeling is a team exercise, including product owners, architects, security champions, and security testers. At this maturity level, expose teams and stakeholders to threat modeling to increase security awareness and to create a shared vision on the security of the system.

At maturity level 1, you perform threat modeling ad-hoc for high-risk applications and use simple threat checklists, such as STRIDE. Avoid lengthy workshops and overly detailed lists of low-relevant threats. Perform threat modeling iteratively to align to more iterative development paradigms. If you add new functionality to an existing application, look only into the newly added functions instead of trying to cover the entire scope. A good starting point is the existing diagrams that you annotate during discussion workshops. Always make sure to persist the outcome of a threat modeling discussion for later use.

Your most important tool to start threat modeling is a whiteboard, smartboard, or a piece of paper. Aim for security awareness, a simple process, and actionable outcomes that you agree upon with your team.

One important test is how many requests per second an application can handle while remaining within its performance requirements. Testing from a single IP address is still useful as it gives an indication of how many requests an attacker must generate to impact the application.

Denial of service attacks typically result in application resource starvation or exhaustion. To determine if any resources can be used to create a denial of service, analyze each application resource to see how it can be exhausted. Prioritise actions unauthenticated user can do.

This gives you an idea of how they organize themselves and elements to evaluate whether you need to take additional measures to mitigate potential risks. Ideally, speak to different roles in the organization, or even set up a small maturity evaluation to this end. Strong suppliers will run their own software assurance program and will be able to answer most of your questions. If suppliers have weak competences in software security, discuss with them how and to what extent they plan to work on this and evaluate whether this is enough for your organization.

Collect and evaluate reusable systems to assemble a list of such resources and categorize them by the security mechanism they fulfill. Consider each resource in terms of why a product team would want to integrate with it, i.e. the benefits of using the shared resource.

If multiple resources exist in each category, select and standardize on one or more shared service per category. Because future software development will rely on these services, review each thoroughly to ensure understanding of the baseline security posture. For each selected service, create design guidance for product teams to understand how to integrate with the system. Make the guidance available through training, mentorship, guidelines, and standards.

Establish a set of best practices representing sound methods of implementing security functionality. You can research them or purchase them, and it is often more effective if you customize them so they are more specific to your organization. Example patterns include a single-sign-on subsystem, a cross-tier delegation model, a separation-of-duties authorization model, a centralized logging pattern, etc.

These patterns can originate from specific projects or applications, but make sure you share them between different teams across the organization for efficient and consistent application of appropriate security solutions.

To increase adoption of these patterns, link them to the shared security services, or implement them into actual component solutions that can be easily integrated into an application during development. Support the key technologies within the organization, for instance in case of different development stacks. Treat these solutions as actual applications with proper support in case of questions or issues.

<div class="desc">Conduct security awareness training for all roles currently involved in the management, development, testing, or auditing of the software. The goal is to increase the awareness of application security threats and risks, security best practices, and secure software design principles. Develop training internally or procure it externally. Ideally, deliver training in person so participants can have discussions as a team, but Computer-Based Training (CBT) is also an option.

Course content should include a range of topics relevant to application security and privacy, while remaining accessible to a non-technical audience. Suitable concepts are secure design principles including Least Privilege, Defense-in-Depth, Fail Secure (Safe), Complete Mediation, Session Management, Open Design, and Psychological Acceptability. Additionally, the training should include references to any organization-wide standards, policies, and procedures defined to improve application security. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities should be covered at a high level.

Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance. Consider incorporating innovative ways of delivery (such as gamification) to maximize its effectiveness and combat desensitization.

Conduct security awareness training for all roles currently involved in the management, development, testing, or auditing of the software. The goal is to increase the awareness of application security threats and risks, security best practices, and secure software design principles. Develop training internally or procure it externally. Ideally, deliver training in person so participants can have discussions as a team, but Computer-Based Training (CBT) is also an option.

Course content should include a range of topics relevant to application security and privacy, while remaining accessible to a non-technical audience. Suitable concepts are secure design principles including Least Privilege, Defense-in-Depth, Fail Secure (Safe), Complete Mediation, Session Management, Open Design, and Psychological Acceptability. Additionally, the training should include references to any organization-wide standards, policies, and procedures defined to improve application security. The OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities should be covered at a high level.

Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance. Consider incorporating innovative ways of delivery (such as gamification) to maximize its effectiveness and combat desensitization.

Review any deployment tools, ensuring that they are actively maintained by vendors and up to date with security patches. Harden each tool’s configuration so that it is aligned with vendor guidelines and industry best practices. Given that most of these tools require access to the production environment, their security is extremely critical.

One major theme for improvement across the Objectives is providing training for employees and increasing their security awareness, either through instructor-led sessions or computer-based modules. As an organization progresses, it builds a broad base of training starting with developers and moving to other roles, culminating with the addition of role-based training to ensure applicability and effectiveness.

In addition to training, this practice also requires the organization to make a significant investment in improving organizational culture to promote application security through collaboration between teams.

<h2>https://owaspsamm.org/model/Practice</h2>

<div class="desc">Once your organization has applications in operation, you're likely to face security incidents. In this model, we define a security incident as a breach, or the threat of an imminent breach, of at least one asset's security goals, whether due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include: a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application, an application user accessing private data of another by abusing a security vulnerability, or an attacker modifying application source code. The Incident Management (IM) practice focuses on dealing with these in your organization.

Historically, many security incidents have been detected months, or even years, after the initial breach. During the "dwell time" before an incident is detected, significant damage can occur, increasing the difficulty of recovery. Our first activity stream, Incident Detection, focuses on decreasing that dwell time.

Once you have identified that you're suffering from a security incident, it's essential to respond in a disciplined, thorough manner to limit the damage, and return to normal operations as efficiently as possible. This is the focus of our second stream.

Once your organization has applications in operation, you're likely to face security incidents. In this model, we define a security incident as a breach, or the threat of an imminent breach, of at least one asset's security goals, whether due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include: a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application, an application user accessing private data of another by abusing a security vulnerability, or an attacker modifying application source code. The Incident Management (IM) practice focuses on dealing with these in your organization.

Historically, many security incidents have been detected months, or even years, after the initial breach. During the "dwell time" before an incident is detected, significant damage can occur, increasing the difficulty of recovery. Our first activity stream, Incident Detection, focuses on decreasing that dwell time.

Once you have identified that you're suffering from a security incident, it's essential to respond in a disciplined, thorough manner to limit the damage, and return to normal operations as efficiently as possible. This is the focus of our second stream.

The goal of the Requirements-driven Testing (RT) practice is to ensure that the implemented security controls operate as expected and satisfy the project's stated security requirements. It does so by incrementally building a set of security test and regression cases and executing them regularly.

A key aspect of this practice is its attention to both positive and negative testing. The former verifies that the application's security controls satisfy stated security requirements and validates their correct functioning. These requirements are typically functional in nature. Negative testing addresses the quality of the implementation of the security controls and aims to detect unexpected design flaws and implementation bugs through misuse and abuse testing. In its more advanced forms, the practice promotes security stress testing, such as denial of service, and strives to continuously improve application security by consistently automating security unit tests and creating security regression tests for all bugs identified and fixed.

Although both the Requirements-driven Testing and Security Testing practices are concerned with security testing, the former focuses on verifying the correct implementation of security requirements, while the latter aims to uncover technical implementation weaknesses in an application, irrespective of requirements.

streamline the expectations in terms of secure development because outsourced development
can have significant impact on the security of the application. The security of
3rd party (technical) libraries is part of the software supply chains stream (see

<div class="desc">The Security Testing (ST) practice leverages the fact that, while automated security testing is fast and scales well to numerous applications, in-depth testing based on good knowledge of an application and its business logic is often only possible via slower, manual expert security testing. Each stream therefore has one approach at its core.

The first stream focuses on establishing a common security baseline to automatically detect so-called "low hanging fruit". Progressively customize the automated tests for each application and increase their frequency of execution to detect more bugs and regressions earlier, as close as possible to their inception. The more bugs the automated processes can detect, the more time experts have to use their knowledge and creativity to focus on more complex attack vectors and ensure in-depth application testing in the second stream. As manual review is slow and hard to scale, reviewers prioritize testing components based on their risk, recent relevant changes, or upcoming major releases. Organizations can also access external expertise by participating in bug bounty programs, for example.

Unlike the Requirements-driven testing practice which focuses on verifying that applications correctly implement their requirements, the goal of this practice is to uncover technical and business-logic weaknesses in application and make them visible to management and business stakeholders, irrespective of requirements.

Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.

By starting with simple threat models and building application risk profiles, an organization improves over time. Ultimately, a sophisticated organization would maintain this information in a way that is tightly coupled to the compensating factors and pass-through risks from external entities.
