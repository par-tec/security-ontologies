#The title of this activity
title: Establish hardening baselines

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Consistent hardening of technology stack components in your organization

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Perform consistent hardening of configurations, following established
  baselines and guidance.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Establish configuration hardening baselines for all components in each technology stack used. To assist with consistent application of the hardening baselines, develop configuration guides for the components. Require product teams to apply configuration baselines to all new systems, and to existing systems when practicable.

  Place hardening baselines and configuration guides under change management, and assign an owner to each. Owners have ongoing responsibility to keep them up-to-date, based on evolving best practices or changes to the relevant components (e.g., version updates, new features).

  In larger environments, derive configurations of instances from a locally maintained master, with relevant configuration baselines applied. Employ automated tools for hardening configurations.
