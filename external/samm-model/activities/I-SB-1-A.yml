#The title of this activity
title: Define a consistent build process

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Limited risk of human error during build process minimizing security issues

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Create a formal definition of the build process so that it becomes
  consistent and repeatable.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Define the build process, breaking it down into a set of clear instructions to either be followed by a person or an automated tool. The build process definition describes the whole process end-to-end so that the person or tool can follow it consistently each time and produce the same result. The definition is stored centrally and accessible to any tools or people. Avoid storing multiple copies as they may become unaligned and outdated.

  The process definition does not include any secrets (specifically considering those needed during the build process).

  Review any build tools, ensuring that they are actively maintained by vendors and up-to-date with security patches. Harden each toolâ€™s configuration so that it is aligned with vendor guidelines and industry best practices.

  Determine a value for each generated artifact that can be later used to verify its integrity, such as a signature or a hash. Protect this value and, if the artifact is signed, the private signing certificate.

  Ensure that build tools are routinely patched and properly hardened.
