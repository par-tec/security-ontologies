#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Using the set of security test cases identified for each project, conduct manual penetration testing to evaluate the systemâ€™s performance against each case. Generally, this happens during the testing phase prior to release and includes both static and dynamic manual penetration testing. In cases where software cannot be realistically tested outside of production, use of techniques such as blue-green deployments or A/B testing can allow ring-fenced security testing in production.

  Penetration testing cases include both application-specific tests to check soundness of business logic, and common vulnerability tests to check the design and implementation. Once specified, security-savvy quality assurance or development staff can execute security test cases. The central software security group monitors first-time execution of security test cases for a project team to assist and coach the team security champions.

  Many organizations offer "Bug Bunty" programmes which invite security researchers to find vulnerabilties in applications and report them responsibly in exchange for rewards. The approach allows organizations to access a bigger pool of talent, especially those lacking sufficient internal capacity or requiring the additional assurance.

  Prior to release or mass deployment, stakeholders review results of security tests and accept the risks indicated by failing security tests at release time. Establish a concrete timeline to address the gaps over time. Spread the knowledge of manual security testing and the results across the development team to improve security knowledge and awareness inside the organization.
