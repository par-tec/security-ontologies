#The title of this activity
title: Define basic defect metrics

#Describe the benefit that is achieved by implementing this activity
benefit: Identification of quick wins derived from available defect information

#A one sentence description of the activity
shortDescription: Regularly go over previously recorded security defects and derive
  quick wins from basic metrics.

#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Once per defined period of time (typically at least once per year), go over your both resolved and still open recorded security defects in every team and extract basic metrics from the available data. These might include:

  * The total number of defects versus total number of verification activities. This could give you an idea whether you're looking for defects with an adequate intensity and quality.
  * The software components the defects reside in. This is indicative of where attention might be most required, and where security flaws might be more likely to appear in the future again.
  * The type or category of the defect, which suggests areas where the development team need further training.
  * The severity of the defect, which can help the team understand the softwareâ€™s risk exposure.

  Identify and carry out sensible quick win activities which you can derive from the newly acquired knowledge. These might include things like a knowledge sharing session about one particular vulnerability type or carrying out / automating a security scan.
