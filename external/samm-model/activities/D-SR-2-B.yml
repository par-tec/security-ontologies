#A multi-paragraph description of the activity
longDescription: |
  Increase your confidence in the capability of your suppliers for software security. Discuss concrete responsibilities and expectations from your suppliers and your own organization and establish a contract with the supplier. The responsibilities can be specific quality requirements or particular tasks, and minimal service can be detailed in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). A quality requirement example is that they will deliver software that is protected against the OWASP Top 10, and in case issues are detected, these will be fixed. A task example is that they have to perform continuous static code analysis, or perform an independent penetration test before a major release. The agreement stipulates liabilities and caps in case an important issue arises.

  Once you have implemented this for a few suppliers, work towards a standard agreement for suppliers that forms the basis of your negotiations. You can deviate from this standard agreement on a case by case basis, but it will help you to ensure you do not overlook important topics.
