      risk:
      - If errors are experienced during the deployment process you want to deploy
        an old release. However, due to changes in the database this is often unfeasible.
      measure: Performing automated periodical backups are used. Backup before deployment
        can help facilitate deployments whilst testing the backup restore processes.
