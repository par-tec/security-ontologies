Test and Verification:
  Consolidation:
    Advanced visualization of defects:
      risk:
      - Correlation of the vulnerabilities of different tools to have an overview
        of the the overall security level per component/project/team is not given.
      measure: Findings are visualized per component/project/team.

    Definition of quality gates:
      risk:
      - Improper examination of vulnerabilities leads to no visibility at all.
      measure: |-
        Quality gates for found vulnerabilities are defined.
        In the beginning it is important to not overload the security analyst,
        therefore the recommendation
        is to start with alerting of high critical vulnerabilities.

    Integration of vulnerability issues into the development process:
      risk:
      - To read console output of the build server to search for vulnerabilities might
        be difficult. Also, to check a vulnerability management system might not be
        a daily task for a developer.
      measure: Vulnerabilities are tracked in the teams issue system (e.g. jira).

    Reproducible defect tickets:
      risk:
      - Vulnerability descriptions are hard to understand by staff from operations
        and development.
      measure: Vulnerabilities include the test procedure to give the staff from operations
        and development the ability to reproduce vulnerabilities. This enhances the
        understanding of vulnerabilities and therefore the fix have a higher quality.

    Simple false positive treatment:
      risk:
      - As false positive occur during each test, all vulnerabilities might be ignored.
      measure: False positives are suppressed so they will not show up on the next
        tests again. Most security tools have the possibility to suppress false positives.
        A Vulnerability Management System might be used.

    Usage of a vulnerability management system:
      risk:
      - Maintenance of false positives in each tool enforces a high workload. In addition
        a correlation of the same finding from different tools is not possible.
      measure: Aggregation of vulnerabilities in one tool reduce the workload to mark
        false positives.
