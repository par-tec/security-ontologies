      \ occur to the end users.  \n(2) twice a day a rebuild of images is done. The\
      \ rebuilds are put into a automated testing pipeline. If the testing has no\
      \ blocking issues the new images will be released for deployment during the\
      \ next \"restart\" of a container. What has to be done, is to ensure the new\
      \ containers are deployed in some canary deployment manner, this will ensure\
      \ that if (and only if) something buggy has been introduced which breaks functionality\
      \ the canary deployment will make sure the \"older version\" is being used and\
